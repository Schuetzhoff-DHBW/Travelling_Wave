# Travelling_Wave
From this repository, you can download the source code for an MATLAB App, which simulates travelling waves on electrical transmission lines.
Developed with MATLAB R2022a Update 2

# Installation:
- Download .zip-File
- Unzip in any location
- Open MATLAB
- Navigate to the unzipped Folder
- Open "Wanderwellen_App.mlapp" by double click
- In MATLAB App Designer, press the green Run button to run the program

# How to start a simulation:
- Choose an Voltage Source (AC/DC) and the Impedance of the Source
- Choose the Parameters of the Transmission Line.
- Choose the Line Termination
- Set the Simulation Time
- Press "Start Simulation"

# How to start the Presentation of the Results:
- Select the Positions, where you want to see the oscillations (default: start and end)
- Set Width of the Timeframe (default: Simulation Time)
- Set the transit time of the wave
- Press "Start Presentation"

# How to use the Presentation Window:
- With the small slider on the bottom left, you can change the speed of the presentation
- With the "Cancel" Button, you can cancel the Presentation
- After pressing "Pause/Continue", you can use the big slider on the bottom to naviagate to a custom progress of presentation
- Press "Pause/Continue" to continue the original presentation
